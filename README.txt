Alden's README:

Cloned from https://github.com/brikis98/terraform-up-and-running-code on 12/21/21.
On 12/21/21 Modified subfolders of code/terraform/02-intro-to-terraform-syntax/ to:
1)  Change region to us-west-2
2)  Make compatible with current aws and terraform versions.
Mostly this involved making the same changes to the beginning of all main.tf files.
But see the README.txt files.
